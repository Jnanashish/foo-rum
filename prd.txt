The goal of the task is to build a mini frontend app with an auth flow provided in the design linked above. (Just the frontend, NO NEED to create a backend or APIs)

- You are free to choose your choice of framework [React (preferred) / Vue / Svelte / Next]
- You are free to choose either JavaScript or TypeScript (highly preferred)
- You are free to choose your choice of CSS framework [TailwindCSS (preferred) / styled-components / stitches / anything else]The twist

### Core Features :

The app consists of three main pages: Feed, Sign In, and Sign Up.

- Feed page serves as the landing page
- For unauthenticated users, any interaction on feed triggers a sign in/sign up modal
- After authentication, users can fully interact with the feed page
- Users can also sign in/sign up from dedicated auth pages.

### Feed Page Interactions :

- Post Editor: Only implement input field and publish button functionality. Other buttons should display an alert saying 'function not implemented'
- New Posts: Successfully published posts should appear in the feed
- Existing Posts: All interactive elements should show same alert - no need to implement full functionality

### Evaluation criteria :

- Quality of UI and animations.
- Dependencies used (Use of UI libraries is strongly discouraged).
- Modularity and maintainability of the code
- API design of the components / functionsÂ *(API here isn't REST API).*
- How well you grasp and implement the UX / functionality of the given design.

### After Completion :

- Deploy the app on a platform of your choice to provide a live preview.
- Push the code to a GitHub repository.
- Share the links to both the live preview and the GitHub repository.
- Quick note about what was fun/challenging - optional

### Bonus points if you add

- Some slick animations
- TypeScript
